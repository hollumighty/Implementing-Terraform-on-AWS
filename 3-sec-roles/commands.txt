TASK- For security concerns, the security team wants to have a seperate AWS security where they will have the security-vpc specifically for security services and limit everyones access to the account
And the plan is to pair all other vpcs and vpcs that will be created to the security-vpc
We achieve this by VPC PEERING 
we create a peering-policy on the security account
we create a peering-role and assign the policy to the role
on the dev-vpc account we create a assume-role-policy, so any one attached to this role can have the peering permission
we then create a peering group and we add individuals to this group and they can auntomatically have the peering connection


# You will be using two AWS profiles
# infra will be the use ElVasquez in the infrastructure account
# sec will be the user JaGibson in the security account
# You will need to have created these users in the console already

aws configure --profile infra

# Provide the Access and Secret keys

aws configure --profile sec

# Provide the Access and Secret keys

# Initialize terraform

terraform init

# Run terraform plan
terraform plan -out roles.tfplan

# Run terraform apply
terraform apply roles.tfplan

# Make note of the peer_role_arn, you'll need it in the next step
